      <h2>What am I doing?</h2>
      <p>
      There are 4 sections to this workshop. You can either work through them in order, or choose whatever looks fun. This will work better if you form a group and discuss. If you need any help, or have questions, get the attention of one of the friendly workshop assistants -- Gabor, Lilly, or Robin.
      <ol>
      <li>"Set up a hidden service" gets a Tor hidden service up and running on your laptop</li>
      <li>"Get a fancy .onion name" shows how to get a nice-looking .onion name by brute force. You need to complete section 1 or 3 first.</li>
      <li>"Manage a server anonymously" shows how to get a virtual private server up and running your hidden service without revealing your identity</li>
      <li>"Scan for leaks" invites you to play with OnionScan, a leak detector for hidden services</li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <h2>Why would I do that?</h2>
      <p>
      Remember the internet of the 90's and early 2000's, when you could type whatever you wanted into Altavista without fear of ending up "on a list"?
      </p>
      <p>
      Well those days are gone. We can safely assume we're being watched. How can we speak our minds, explore ideas, or follow our true interests with Big Brother looking over our shoulders?
      </p>
      <p>
      The anonymous internet that we remember is still all around us; it's just not as visible as it used to be. It's our job to bring that internet back and make it mainstream again.
      </p>
      <p>
      To make this happen, we need to build stuff -- awesome sites and services that are available anonymously.
      </p>

      <h2>What do I need?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A computer with an internet connection (conference wi-fi, or preferably your own mobile internet)
          <ul>
            <li>if downloading is too slow or expensive, and you are happy to plug in a USB drive containing Tor and Tor Browser instead, please ask for one.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Preferably a computer running Linux or Mac OS X. You can probably get things working in Windows but the instructions won't help much.
        </li>
        <li>A little bit of background knowledge
          <ul>
            <li>What Tor is (<a href="https://tor.eff.org/about/overview.html.en">this covers it</a>)</li>
            <li>Basic *nix command line</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>This is a learning exercise, designed to demystify Tor hidden services, and should be taken with a grain of salt. Don't expect to be untraceable at the end of this hour. For in-depth configuration suggestions see <a href="https://www.bentasker.co.uk/documentation/linux/307-building-a-tor-hidden-service-from-scratch-part-1">this 3-part tutorial.</a></p>
