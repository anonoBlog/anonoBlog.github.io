      Remember the internet of the 90s and early 2000s? Back then, you could say what you want without fear of "going on a list". The only rule was never to reveal your real identity.
      </p>
      <p>
      Lately the only thing we can assume is that we're being watched. How can we speak our minds or follow our true interests with someone looking over our shoulders. This is not the internet I grew up with.
      </p>
      <p>
      Our internet is far from gone though, the anonymous internet that we remember is still all around us it's just not as visible as it used to be. As technical people, it's our job to bring that internet back and make it the mainstream again.
      </p>
      <p>
      In order for this to happen, we need to build stuff!

      Awesome sites and services that are available anonymously. On this site I will share my experience hosting simple web services anonymously. It's taken me a while and a few mistakes to figure this out so hopefully I can speed up the process for you!
